    "### Problem 5.3∗ Suppose we want to build a model that predicts the direction y in radians of the prevailing wind based on local measurements of barometric pressure x. A suitable distribution over circular domains is the von Mises distribution (figure 5.13): P r(y|µ, κ) = exp κ cos[y − µ] 2π · Bessel0[κ],where µ is a measure of the mean direction and κ is a measure of concentration (i.e., the inverse of the variance). The term Bessel0[κ] is a modified Bessel function of the first kind of order 0. Use the recipe from section 5.2 to develop a loss function for learning the parameter µ of a model f[x, ϕ] to predict the most likely wind direction. Your solution should treat the concentration κ as constant. How would you perform inference?"

    "### Problem 5.4∗ Sometimes, the outputs y for input x are multimodal (figure 5.14a); there is more than one valid prediction for a given input. Here, we might use a weighted sum of normal components as the distribution over the output. This is known as a mixture of Gaussians model. For example, a mixture of two Gaussians has parameters θ = {λ, µ1, σ12 1, µ2, σ22}: P r(y|λ, µ1, µ2, σ21, σ22) = λp2πσ21 exp \u0014−(y − µ1)22σ21\u0015 + 1 − λp2πσ22exp \u0014−(y − µ2)22σ22\u0015, (5.35) where λ ∈ [0, 1] controls the relative weight of the two components, which have means µ1, µ2and variances σ21, σ22, respectively. This model can represent a distribution with two peaks (figure 5.14b) or a distribution with one peak but a more complex shape (figure 5.14c).Use the recipe from section 5.2 to construct a loss function for training a model f[x, ϕ] that takes input x, has parameters ϕ, and predicts a mixture of two Gaussians. The loss should be based on I training data pairs {xi, yi}. What problems do you foresee when performing inference?"
